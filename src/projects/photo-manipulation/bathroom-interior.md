The original photo did not flatter this bathroom, to say the least. My goal was to show that a few minor changes and corrections can go a long way in showmanship.

Here are a list of edits that I made: 

1. I made some fixes to the bathroom cupboard and vanity, toilet paper holder, blue door near the toilet, and outlets on the wall. 
2. Some overall color correction to remove the yellow tint produced by the lights. 
3. I made some further adjustments to the color on the bathroom sink, since it was particularly yellow.
4. I cleaned up the glass window a bit to remove the smudges.
