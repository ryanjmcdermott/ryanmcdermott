This explainer video was created at my time with Coloff Digital. I was involved in the entire process, from start to finish, and our graphic designer created the graphics in the video (with the exception of the logos).

I really enjoyed creating this one. It's very different from any of the other videos I'd made up to this point. I love the simplicity of this animation style and would love to make more like this in the future. Here's my take on the highs and lows of this project:

### Areas that I'm happy with:
1. Since we were covering similar features for each type of card, we felt that we needed a constant reminder of which card was being discussed. The transition from the introduction of each card to the same card popping up in the bottom right corner felt like a good solution and I'm happy with how it turned out.
2. Visually, I like that we used only black and the TSB green for the entirety of the video. 
3. I think the music track was a good fit for the video in pacing and energy. It also syncs up pretty nicely with the visuals.

### Areas that needed work:
1. The bar graph animation shown around 0:24 could have used some work in the coloring and motion aspects.
2. There are a few features that simply cut to white before continuing onto the next one. Cuts certainly work at times, but I think some of these could have used a better transition.
