This explainer video was created at my time with Coloff Digital. I was involved in the entire process, from start to finish, and our graphic designer created the graphics in the video (with the exception of the logos).

Here's my take on the highs and lows of this project:

### Areas that I'm happy with:
1. I think the visuals flow nicely from beginning to end.
2. This is one of the first projects where I began adding some of the small visual flares that help bring movement to life. (e.g., leaves popping out of the potted plants, wind gust blowing through the door at ~0:22). I've found that they don't take much additional time and can really make a difference in the end result.

### Areas that needed work:
1. Music-wise, I think the track is a bit off-pace with the voiceover and visuals.
2. The business account type titles could have used something extra. I'm not a huge fan of how they were brought on-screen looking back.
3. The list items could have used a bit more of flare with their animation on-screen as well.
