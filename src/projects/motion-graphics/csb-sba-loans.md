This explainer video was created at my time with Coloff Digital. I was involved in the entire process, from start to finish, and our graphic designer created the graphics in the video (with the exception of the logos).

I have very mixed feelings about this project, as there are sections that I love and sections that could have used **a lot** more work. 

### Areas that I'm happy with:
1. I'm still very happy with how the stack of papers turned out. Very simple movements make it feel very much alive. I liked the animations of the complex max formula shown on the top page. 
2. The building and store owner are fairly simple, but look smooth and natural. I think a bit more movement from the store owner could have been nice, but overall... I'll take it. 
3. The animation of the SBA logo is up there as my personal highlight of the video. A simple 180 rotation makes it look more complex than it really is. 
4. The end scene with the link looks nice and flows well with the voiceover. (My only regret is not adding a camera dolly here and leading into the logo).

### Areas that needed work:
1. The first text-based section could have benefited largely from some movement - either in the form of text animation or a camera dolly effect.
2. The following scene showing the SBA and CSB buildings needed some additional visuals to accompany the voiceover. Instead, we're left staring at some floating buildings while we wait for the movement to continue...
3. The three text list items that appear next look great, but would have benefited from a gradient mask instead of a hard edged mask when they move in from the left.

While, I think this project would have benefited largely from some additional story-boarding and group collaboration/feedback, this was one of the first mograph projects that I really felt good about. Progress is progress.
