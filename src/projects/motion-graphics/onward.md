This service explainer was completed over a timeframe of approximately 5 months, from beginning to end. While this far exceeded the estimate for this project, this was due to a number of delays as well as the unforseen complexity of the project. This served as a solid reminder on the importance of setting tighter deadlines, even when a client is not in a rush to have their final deliverable. With all of this in mind, I had a great time working with Onward and I was very happy with the finished product.

The majority of the graphics used in this video were created by a personal friend and member of Onward's team. There were minimal graphics that I created on the fly to suit the video's needs.
