This explainer video was created at my time with Coloff Digital. I was involved in the entire process, from start to finish, and our graphic designer created the graphics in the video (with the exception of the logos).

I have pretty mixed feelings about this project. I loved the fun story-telling approach, so I certainly enjoyed making it. Here's my take on the highs and lows:

### Areas that I'm happy with:
1. The hula girl on the car's dash, obviously. To be fair, it could have been animated better, but it's pretty cute, right? 
2. I didn't know how the road was going to look starting out, but I'm happy with the end result.
3. Getting the car to drive over the hills towards the bank was more challenging than I initially thought it would be. Getting this done served as a great learning experience and I think it was worth putting the time into to get the visual I was going for.  
4. This was one of the first videos where I really paid attention to the sound design with sound effects. While some should have addmittedly been more subtle, I think they work pretty well. 
5. Getting our main character's head to hit the desk was pretty satisfying with that "thump" sound effect. 

### Areas that needed work:
1. The scene where our main character jumps out of his moving car was difficult to say the least. I'm still not super happy with the end result. I don't believe I had discovered the Rubber Hose plugin at this point, so I'll cut myself a bit of slack...
2. The character's full body movements in most scenes are pretty lacking and in general just seem unrealistic and fake. 
3. The end scene should have utilized a zoom out of the window or, at the very least, a zoom closer to the window. The end reveal of the TSB Bank sign out of the window simply isn't clear or large enough on screen. I tried using a blur to bring more focus to the window, but it was not the correct approach here.
4. The butterflies feel flat and unrealistic in their movement. A subtle detail, but they could have used some work.
