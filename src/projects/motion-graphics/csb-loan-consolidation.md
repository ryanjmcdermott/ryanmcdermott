This explainer video was created at my time with Coloff Digital. I was involved in the entire process, from start to finish, and our graphic designer created the graphics in the video (with the exception of the logos).

I'm really happy with how this video turned out, overall. Let's cover the highs and the lows from my perspective:

### Areas that I'm happy with:
1. It made sense to physically combine the different loans in the starting scene. Doing so took a bit of thought, but I think the camera movement and flash worked well together. 
2. The second scene with the three "budget and lifestyle" circles is my favorite section of the video. I loved the subtle movements of each and it just felt good.
3. We used a lot of circles in this video, which made for similar a lot of radial transitions in one way or another. I liked that in this scenario.
4. The music selection for this video was great and I was able to time it to the visuals, which helped the overall flow.
5. Our voiceover artist did a great job, too. I think her voice was a great fit for the video.

### Areas that needed work:
1. The first scene with the loans consolidating has a bit of stagnancy while the voiceover wraps up... this could have used a little something extra.
2. The hands in the first scene also could have used more movement in the fingers. This would have required some graphic reworking, but I think it would have been worth the time/effort.
3. In the following scene with the three lifestyle circles, a bit of a blur for the background may have been good when the red circle pops up.
4. The end scene with the link could have used a bit of a camera dolly or some added movement. It's a bit stale, as is.
