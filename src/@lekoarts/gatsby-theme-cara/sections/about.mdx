## About

> I'm a detail-oriented web developer and motion designer, based out of Northeast Iowa.

I graduated from the University of Northern Iowa in 2017, earning my Bachelor's with a double major in **Digital Media Production** and **Interactive Digital Studies**. After working for Coloff Digital for 2Â½ years, I left to start my own business, Red Tadpole.

While my focus tends to lie in web development and motion design, I'm also experienced and passionate about photo manipulation and editing. I hold high value in photography's ability to capture a moment that may otherwise become foggy or forgotten.

What's that? You want to know about who I am outside of work? How thoughtful. ðŸ˜Š 
When I'm not at my computer, I love spending time outdoors; rock climbing, running, and getting in the water are among my favorite outdoor activities, but the list goes on. I also enjoy building things with my hands. To relax, I like to catch up on my favorite shows or game.
